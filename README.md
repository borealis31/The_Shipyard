# The_Shipyard

## Summary
The_Shipyard is a foray into object-oriented programming that explores things such as file in/out, classes, and recursive functions. It was prototyped and tested in MATLAB Scripting Language, and I have plans to rewrite it in C++. The MATLAB code has complete documentation and error detection for invalid inputs that may or may not be impactful to the code. If you have any questions on how it works, feel free to email me at jakeb.chouinard@gmail.com.
